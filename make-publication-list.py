However, previous approaches to exoskeleton perception greatly simplify the problem to specific types of environments, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose the challenging and novel problem of predicting human-scene collisions for diverse environments from multi-view egocentric RGB videos captured from an exoskeleton. By classifying which body joints will collide with the environment and predicting a collision region heatmap that localizes potential collisions in the environment, we aim to develop an exoskeleton perception system that generalizes to complex real-world scenes and provides actionable outputs for downstream control. We propose COPILOT, a video transformer-based model that performs both collision prediction and localization simultaneously, leveraging multi-view video inputs via a proposed joint space-time-viewpoint attention operation. To train and evaluate the model, we build a synthetic data generation framework to simulate virtual humans moving in photo-realistic 3D environments. This framework is then used to establish a dataset consisting of 8.6M egocentric RGBD frames to enable future work on the problem. Extensive experiments suggest that our model achieves promising performance and generalizes to unseen scenes as well as real world. We apply COPILOT to a downstream collision avoidance task, and successfully reduce collision cases by 29% on unseen scenes using a simple closed-loop control algorithm.", None),

In this paper, we present ATISS, a novel autoregressive transformer architecture for creating diverse and plausible synthetic indoor environments, given only the room type and its floor plan. In contrast to prior work, which poses scene synthesis as sequence generation, our model generates rooms as unordered sets of objects. We argue that this formulation is more natural, as it makes ATISS generally useful beyond fully automatic room layout synthesis. For example, the same trained model can be used in interactive applications for general scene completion, partial room re-arrangement with any objects specified by the user, as well as object suggestions for any partial room. To enable this, our model leverages the permutation equivariance of the transformer when conditioning on the partial scene, and is trained to be permutation-invariant across object orderings. Our model is trained end-to-end as an autoregressive generative model using only labeled 3D bounding boxes as supervision. Evaluations on four room types in the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that our model consistently generates plausible room layouts that are more realistic than existing methods. In addition, it has fewer parameters, is simpler to implement and train and runs up to 8x faster than existing methods.", None),

In parallel, primitive-based methods seek to represent objects as semantically consistent part arrangements. However, due to the simplicity of existing primitive representations, these methods fail to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes using a small number of primitives/parts. We address the trade-off between reconstruction quality and number of parts with Neural Parts, a novel 3D primitive representation that defines primitives using an Invertible Neural Network (INN) which implements homeomorphic mappings between a sphere and the target object. The INN allows us to compute the inverse mapping of the homeomorphism, which in turn, enables the efficient computation of both the implicit surface function of a primitive and its mesh, without any additional post-processing. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into semantically consistent part arrangements without any part-level supervision.

However, the majority of these methods focuses on recovering the local 3D geometry of an object without considering its part-based decomposition or relations between parts. We address this challenging problem by proposing a novel formulation that allows to jointly recover the geometry of a 3D object as a set of primitives as well as their latent hierarchical structure without part-level supervision. Our model recovers the higher level structural decomposition of various objects in the form of a binary tree of primitives, where simple parts are represented with fewer primitives and more complex parts are modeled with more components.

Simultaneously, these applications are often not restricted to image-based estimation: laser scanners provide a popular alternative to traditional cameras, for example in the context of self-driving cars, as they directly yield a 3D point cloud. In this paper, we propose to estimate 3D motion from such unstructured point clouds using a deep neural network. In a single forward pass, our model jointly predicts 3D scene flow as well as the 3D bounding box and rigid body motion of objects in the scene. While the prospect of estimating 3D scene flow from unstructured point clouds is promising, it is also a challenging task. We show that the traditional global representation of rigid body motion prohibits inference by CNNs, and propose a translation equivariant representation to circumvent this problem. For training our deep network, a large dataset is required. Because of this, we augment real scans from KITTI with virtual objects, realistically modeling occlusions and simulating sensor noise.

In addition to its scalability, our method also overcomes the drawbacks of standard, unsupervised LDA for video, including its focus on dominant but often irrelevant video information (e.g. background, camera motion). As a result, experiments in the UCF11 and UCF101 datasets show that our method consistently outperforms unsupervised LDA in every metric. Furthermore, analysis shows that class-relevant topics of fsLDA lead to sparse video representations and encapsulate high-level information corresponding to parts of video events, which we denote 'micro-events'", None),
